Why interfaces are not used for multiple inheritance. 

Actually just refer to the video. 
TextBox: uIcontrol, Size

This is multiple base classes. Which is not allowed.

But you can say it implements these interfaces. 


THERE IS NO CODE TO INHERIT, NO REUSABILITY.

They look like base classes, but thats just syntaxical. 
Classes do not inherit interfaces, but they are used to implement them. 

Interfaces are just a "contract".
