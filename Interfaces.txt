in .Net all interfaces will begin with an I, 
They are not implemented. No access modifiers

What they are used for"

1. Build loosely coupled applications. Restaurant and a chef
	example vs that and a man named john. 


Refer to the actual cs file to get more info 
about interfaces

Be sure to try out unit testing with the new course

shippingcalculator: IshippingCalculator 
means that shipping calculator implements IshippingCalculator.

You want to make them dependent on the interface rather than 
the class. 

Interfaces are an exmaple of loose coupling, they define
the public service that a class must provide.
